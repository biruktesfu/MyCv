                <p class="title">Relative sizing</p>
                <p> Percentage always sets relative to 
                    some other value. For example if you use
                     the percentage of the width of the parent 
                     it will be the percentage of the width of
                      the parent. This means the element using 
                      the percentage depends on its parent size
                       when zoomed since it is the some given 
                       percentage of the parent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    em takes sizing from the parent . For example
                     if there are li elements in a ul with a
                    class of em, the elements takes the sizing
                    from their parent so each successive level
                    of nesting gets progressively larger. When
                    zooming em makes the nested elements larger 
                    than the parents. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    rem takes the sizing of the root element.
                     If there are li elements inside the 
                     with a class of rems, these elements 
                    take their sizing from the parent element.
                    This means each successive level of nesting
                    does not keep getting larger. Using rem makes
                    elements and nested elements to enlarge equally
                    when zoomed.

                <p class="title">Specific changes in CSS3</p>
                <p>
                    CSS3 is the latest standard for the CSS 
                    language. It is backward compatible with 
                    older versions of CSS, and has new properties 
                    that extend CCS2 features, and it’s even got 
                    some JavaScript-like capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>Here are some major changes in CSS3</p>
                <p class="date" >March 20, 2020</p>
                <p>
                    1 . Mobile-first mentality:
                    CSS3 inherently supports responsive
                     design, and is equipped to handle media
                      queries. Media queries are calls made 
                      by the code to determine what device and
                       size and screen a user is viewing the site on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 . Module-based code:
                    One of the biggest developments is 
                    that CSS3 is split into “modules”.
                     All of the old CSS specifications have
                      been migrated over to the new version
                       and divided into smaller pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3 . Web font support gives designers access to way more than just “web safe” fonts: 
                    Before CSS3, designers could only use “web safe” fonts to be 100 percent sure that 
                    the fonts would always display the same on everyone’s machine. Web safe fonts are
                     fonts that every single computer has installed and recognizes. If a designer used 
                     common fonts like Times New Roman or Arial, they could pretty much guarantee that
                      any user would view their site as it was intended. However, if they wanted to use
                       a rarer font, if it wasn’t supported by a users machine, it would default back to
                        a web safe font.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Create 2D and 3D transformations, animations, and transitions:
                    These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink,
                     flip or translate into a different color. For the first time, elements 
                     created in CSS can move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or
                      Flash code. With transitions, an element can seamlessly change size 
                      and color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. New colors and image effects:
                    CSS3 supports new colors (RGBA,HSL, HSLA) and
                     gradient colors, and allows for adjustments to
                      opacity. Another biggie is its support of rounded
                       image corners, an effect that required a lot of 
                       formatting and Photoshop work to achieve before.
